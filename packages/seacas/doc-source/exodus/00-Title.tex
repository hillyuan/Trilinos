\large\bf Abstract	
\end{center}

\exo{} is a model developed to store and retrieve data for finite
element analyses. It is used for preprocessing (problem definition),
postprocessing (results visualization), as well as code to code data
transfer. An \exo{} data file is a random access, machine independent,
binary file that is written and read via C, C++, or Fortran library
routines which comprise the Application Programming Interface (API).
