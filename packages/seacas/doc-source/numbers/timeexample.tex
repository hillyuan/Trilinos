For example, if the times from the database are 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5,
etc.\null, the commands
\cenlinesbegin
\cmd{TMIN 0.0} \\
\cmd{TMAX 5.0} \\
\cmd{NINTV 5}
\cenlinesend
select times 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0. If the \cmd{NINTV} command is
replaced by
\cenlinesbegin
\cmd{ZINTV 3}
\cenlinesend
then times 0.0, 2.5, and 5.0 are selected. If the \cmd{NINTV} command is
replaced by
\cenlinesbegin
\cmd{DELTIME 2.0}
\cenlinesend
then times 0.0, 2.0, 4.0 are selected.
